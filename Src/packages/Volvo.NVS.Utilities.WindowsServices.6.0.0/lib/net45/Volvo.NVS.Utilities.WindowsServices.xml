            <para>
            The '*' character is used to specify all values. For example, &quot;*&quot; 
            in the minute field means &quot;every minute&quot;.
            </para>
            <para>
            The '?' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It
            is used to specify 'no specific value'. This is useful when you need to
            specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other.
            </para>
            <para>
            The '-' character is used to specify ranges For example &quot;10-12&quot; in
            the hour field means &quot;the hours 10, 11 and 12&quot;.
            </para>
            <para>
            The ',' character is used to specify additional values. For example
            &quot;MON,WED,FRI&quot; in the day-of-week field means &quot;the days Monday,
            Wednesday, and Friday&quot;.
            </para>
            <para>
            The '/' character is used to specify increments. For example &quot;0/15&quot;
            in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45&quot;. And 
            &quot;5/15&quot; in the seconds field means &quot;the seconds 5, 20, 35, and
            50&quot;.  Specifying '*' before the  '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is
            the value to start with. Essentially, for each field in the expression, there
            is a set of numbers that can be turned on or off. For seconds and minutes, 
            the numbers range from 0 to 59. For hours 0 to 23, for days of the month 0 to
            31, and for months 1 to 12. The &quot;/&quot; character simply helps you turn
            on every &quot;nth&quot; value in the given set. Thus &quot;7/6&quot; in the
            month field only turns on month &quot;7&quot;, it does NOT mean every 6th 
            month, please note that subtlety.  
            </para>
            <para>
            The 'L' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
            This character is short-hand for &quot;last&quot;, but it has different 
            meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value &quot;L&quot; in 
            the day-of-month field means &quot;the last day of the month&quot; - day 31 
            for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the 
            day-of-week field by itself, it simply means &quot;7&quot; or 
            &quot;SAT&quot;. But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it
            means &quot;the last xxx day of the month&quot; - for example &quot;6L&quot;
            means &quot;the last friday of the month&quot;. You can also specify an offset 
            from the last day of the month, such as "L-3" which would mean the third-to-last 
            day of the calendar month. <i>When using the 'L' option, it is important not to 
            specify lists, or ranges of values, as you'll get confusing/unexpected results.</i>
            </para>
            <para>
            The 'W' character is allowed for the day-of-month field.  This character 
            is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.  As an 
            example, if you were to specify &quot;15W&quot; as the value for the 
            day-of-month field, the meaning is: &quot;the nearest weekday to the 15th of
            the month&quot;. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on 
            Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the
            16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. 
            However if you specify &quot;1W&quot; as the value for day-of-month, and the
            1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 
            'jump' over the boundary of a month's days.  The 'W' character can only be 
            specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
            </para>
            <para>
            The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined for the day-of-month 
            expression to yield 'LW', which translates to &quot;last weekday of the 
            month&quot;.
            </para>
            <para>
            The '#' character is allowed for the day-of-week field. This character is
            used to specify &quot;the nth&quot; XXX day of the month. For example, the 
            value of &quot;6#3&quot; in the day-of-week field means the third Friday of 
            the month (day 6 = Friday and &quot;#3&quot; = the 3rd one in the month). 
            Other examples: &quot;2#1&quot; = the first Monday of the month and 
            &quot;4#5&quot; = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify
            &quot;#5&quot; and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then
            no firing will occur that month. If the '#' character is used, there can
            only be one expression in the day-of-week field (&quot;3#1,6#3&quot; is 
            not valid, since there are two expressions).
            </para>
            <para>
            <!--The 'C' character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields.
            This character is short-hand for "calendar". This means values are
            calculated against the associated calendar, if any. If no calendar is
            associated, then it is equivalent to having an all-inclusive calendar. A
            value of "5C" in the day-of-month field means "the first day included by the
            calendar on or after the 5th". A value of "1C" in the day-of-week field
            means "the first day included by the calendar on or after Sunday". -->

            <b>NOTES:</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Support for specifying both a day-of-week and a day-of-month value is
            not complete (you'll need to use the '?' character in one of these fields).
            </li>
            <li>Overflowing ranges is supported - that is, having a larger number on 
            the left hand side than the right. You might do 22-2 to catch 10 o'clock 
            at night until 2 o'clock in the morning, or you might have NOV-FEB. It is 
            very important to note that overuse of overflowing ranges creates ranges 
            that don't make sense and no effort has been made to determine which 
            interpretation CronExpression chooses. An example would be 
            "0 0 14-6 ? * FRI-MON". </li>

            <para>
            When defining the windows service to be used one must provide information about a class which holds the logic of the windows

            </para>
            <para>
            The class having the logic of the windows service must implement the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> interface. The implementation
            must be registered within the Unity. For example: the following can be used in order to add a registration:

            <para>
            The <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> class enables creation of windows services in a simplified way where
            a developer mainly focuses on the logic of the windows service itself with no need to focus on the service
            installation and service initialization.
            </para>
            <para>
            Common tasks like service management, service operations (when run under the console application) are handled by the
            <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> automatically.

            <para>
            <h3>Creating Windows Service Behaviour</h3>
            </para>
            <para>
            For a simple creation of the NVS Windows Service one must provide the service implementation (the service logic). For 
            this the class implementing the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> should be created. This is the FIRST step required
            to create your own service.
            </para>
            <para>
            If you want to use standard (shared among various libraries and projects) logging capabilities you may derive from the
            <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.WindowsServiceBehaviour"/> class instead of the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> interface. The <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.WindowsServiceBehaviour"/>
            provides the <see cref="F:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.WindowsServiceBehaviour.Logger"/> property which can be used from your service logic class to log
            various information.
            </para>
            <para>
            When your service should only react on Start and Stop commands and will not have a Pause and Resume functionality
            it is possible to derive from the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.StoppableWindowsService"/> class and implement the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.StoppableWindowsService.Stop"/>
            and the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.StoppableWindowsService.Start"/> methods respectively. This is another simplification given over the
            <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.WindowsServiceBehaviour"/> base class. The <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.StoppableWindowsService"/> still provides the basic logging capabilities
            of the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.WindowsServiceBehaviour"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            Various NVS Libraries may provide out of the box implementations of the windows service behaviours, logic. For example <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Batch.BatchWindowsService"/>
            provides the logic for the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> which is responsible for running scheduled batch processes (scheduler).
            </para>
            <para>
            <h3>Passing Windows Service Behaviour</h3>
            </para>
            <para>
            When a class holding the windows service logic is selected or created in order to provide project specific, custom windows service logic
            then the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> must be notified about this implementation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> provides various constructors with multiple parameters where the name, description and the information
            about the windows service logic class can be provided. It all created the code-base configuration of the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            When a name of the windows service behaviour implementation is given (for example into the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService.#ctor(System.String,System.String,System.String)"/>
            then a registration within the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Core.Unity.Container"/> with that name is a must. The <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> must be mapped 
            into the selected or created windows service implementation class.
            </para>
            <para>
            The information about the windows service implementation can also be provided directly by passing an instance of service behaviour object.
            See for example the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService.#ctor(System.String,System.String,Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour)"/> where such an instance can bee given.
            </para>
            <para>
            It is also possible to use the parameter-less <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService.#ctor"/> constructor. In that case the configuration of the service
            is taken according to the performed fluent, common library configuration or from the current application configuration file when no
            fluent and global library configuration has been performed.
            </para>
            <para>
            <h3>Using Application Configuration File</h3>
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> must be mapped into the windows service implementation class within the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Core.Unity.Container"/> when
            the application configuration file is used and no global code based configuration has been performed. The similar Unity configuration can be added
            in such a scenario:

            The above registration specifies the CustomService as the one providing implementation for the windows service logic. It is the CustomService
            which implements the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> directly or indirectly. The registration is added with the 'WindowsServiceBase' 
            as the name. It is a default name used by the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService.#ctor"/> when no custom one is specified.

            <para>
            When the implementation is registered and the configuration in the application configuration file is used the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> must 
            be configured as well. For this a similar configuration can be added into the application configuration file:

            The above configures the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> giving a name of the service and its description. The 'winServiceBaseImplementationName'
            attribute is also set into the 'WindowsServiceBase'. This attribute specifies the name of the registration to be taken from the Unity
            and matches an entry from the unity configuration file in the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.IWindowsServiceBehaviour"/> registration. In our sample it matches
            an entry for the CustomService which is providing a logic for the windows service.
            </para>
            <para>
            The 'WindowsServiceBase' is a default name used even if the 'winServiceBaseImplementationName' would not be given. The name has been provided
            here in order to show usage of the winServiceBaseImplementationName attribute.

            When the complete configuration of the NVS Windows Service basing on the application configuration file is done then the service can be run by

            <para>
            Above code has initialized the service from the current application configuration file as no global, code-based library configuration had been performed.
            One may use global, common, library configuration in order to configure the <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService"/> from code and avoid any entries in the

            <para>
            Assuming we have the library configurator object given or created:

            ...
            Configurator.ConfigureWindowsService(name, "Description", new SampleServiceBehaviour());
            ...
            </code>
            or
            <code>
            Configurator.ConfigureWindowsService(name, "Description", "SampleServiceBehaviourName");
            </code>
            </para>
            <para>
            When the code-based, global service configuration is done a call to <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService.Run"/> or usage of the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.NVSWinService.#ctor"/>
            parameter-less constructor will force usage of the configuration given in code. No application configuration file will be used in that case.

            It gives the <see cref="M:Volvo.NVS.Utilities.WindowsServices.Services.WindowsServiceBehaviour.LogOrWriteInfo(System.String)"/> method which can be used by all other windows service implementations.
            This method logs into the <see cref="T:System.Console"/> if such one is active and with enabled stdin or writes using the
            <see cref="T:Volvo.NVS.Core.Logging.ILogger"/> when its implementation is available.
